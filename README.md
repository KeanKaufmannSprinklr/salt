# About Salt
 A powerful, tagset-independent and theory-neutral meta model and API for storing, manipulating, and representing nearly all types of linguistic data. 

* **language-independent** - Salt supports a huge set of languages and typesets. Each language which can be expressed in UTF-8 is supported by Salt.
* **theory-neutral** - Salt is open to any linguistic school or theory, not limited to a specific one.
* **tagset independent** - Salt is not bound to a tagset. Annotations are represented as attribute-value pairs and can be chosen freely.
* **multimedia support** - Salt is a text-based model, but also supports the modeling of audio and video corpora.
* **multi-laye**r - Salt is not limited to a specific set of annotation layers. Since Salt is a graph-based model, you can model many different structures, such as tree structures, span annotations, coreference chains and so on.
* **open source** - Salt is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and published on Github.
