<div class="textblock"><p>This article gives a brief overview over the Java API of Salt. For giving a short but concise feeling of what Salt is made for, we give examples in Java code, followed by explanations. The description exemplifies the creation of a new corpus, starting from modeling its structure, the primary data, the tokenization, adding annotations, hierarchies and so on. At the end of this article, we show how such a corpus model can be stored as SaltXML and loaded into main memory again. You can download the demonstrated code via github under <a href="https://github.com/korpling/saltDemo">https://github.com/korpling/saltDemo</a>. More code samples can be found in Salt's sample package.</p>
<p>Salt is a graph-based meta model, and therefore each model element in Salt is either a node, a relation, a graph, a label, or a layer. This means nodes can be connected via relations. Nodes and relations are contained in a graph. They also can be contained in layers, which define kinds of sub-graphs. A layer itself is also contained in a graph. Each element can be labeled, even labels can have labels.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sample"></a>The Sample</h3>
<p>In this article, we present only a very simple example to show the main components of Salt in a very brief way. The example is given to clarify the mechanisms of Salt and therefore does not claim to advocate a specific linguistic school. In general, Salt is able to contain very complex corpus structures (which means the inner organization of a corpus), having a recursive sub-corpus - super-corpus structure with a lot of primary data. For simplifying the example, we decided to use just a single corpus object (which is also the root corpus) containing one document. The document contains the primary text "&lt;i&gt;Is this example more complicated than it appears to be?&lt;/i&gt;". After showing how to create a corpus structure in section <a href="#corpusStructure">Corpus Structure</a>, we show a tokenization of the primary text by adding one token for each word of that sentence in <a href="#tokenization">Tokenization</a>. We also illustrate how to annotate these words with part-of-speech and lemma annotations. In <a href="#hierarchies">Hierarchies</a>, we show the modeling of higher hierarchies having a part-of relationship in Salt, modeling a syntax analysis above the given sentence. In Salt, there is also a second way of creating aggregations of tokens called 'spans'. The semantics of spans is slightly different compared to that of hierarchies. In contrast to hierarchies, spans aggregate tokens to a set to be annotated once. You might, for instance, not want to annotate a single token only, but a whole structure containing a set of possibly discontinuous tokens. The use of spans is shown in <a href="#spans">Spans</a> and demonstrated with the use case of an information structure analysis. The last type of model element we show here is a loose relation, or relation, between tokens and/or other structures called pointing relation. To show the use of pointing relations in <a href="#pointingRelations">Pointing Relations</a>, we use an anaphoric annotation to connect the word "&lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;" with the words "&lt;i&gt;this example&lt;/i&gt;".</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="corpusStructure"></a>Corpus Structure</h3>
<p>Due to its graph-based structure, even sub- and super-corpora are modeled as nodes having relations connecting them and creating a containment relationship. The only element not following the graph approach is the element <em>SaltProject</em>. This element serves as container for a set of corpus structures represented via the model element <em>SCorpusGraph</em>. Such a corpus structure is organized as a graph and contains corpora and documents. Salt distinguishes between a corpus (which can contain other corpora and documents) and documents (which only contain the document structure). The document structure itself is organized as a graph called <em>SDocumentGraph</em>. The <em>SDocumentGraph</em> is the element containing the primary data and the linguistic analysis. The corpus structure is just for organizing a complex linguistic project. A corpus in Salt is represented by the element <em>SCorpus</em> and a document is represented by the element <em>SDocument</em>. In this section, we create a simple corpus structure having one corpus and one document. Since corpora and documents are nodes, they can be labeled. To show this mechanism, we create a meta annotation, defining the annotator of that corpus. A meta annotation is represented via the element <em>SMetaAnnotation</em>. The corpus structure created here is shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="./images/userGuide/corpusStructure.png" />
</div>
<p>The following snippet shows the creation of the container object <em>SaltProject</em>, which shall contain our corpus model.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="java">
SaltProject saltProject= SaltFactory.createSaltProject();
</code></pre><p>The next snippet illustrates the creation of the corpus structure by creating a corpus graph, a corpus named 'sampleCorpus' and a document named 'sampleDocument'. Afterwards, the creation of the corpus is shown, followed by a meta annotation declaring its annotator.</p>
<pre>
//creates a new corpus structure
SCorpusGraph corpGraph= saltProject.createCorpusGraph();
//adds a corpus with name sampleCorpus to the corpus structure
SCorpus sampleCorpus= corpGraph.createCorpus(URI.createURI("/sampleCorpus")).get(0);
</pre><p>The meta annotation is created via the method <em>createSMetaAnnotation()</em>. This method takes three arguments: a namespace which is optional and can be used to take up further information, the name of the annotation and the value of the annotation.</p>
<pre>
//creates a meta annotation on the corpus sampleCorpus
sampleCorpus.createMetaAnnotation(null, "annotator", "A. Nyone");
</pre><p>We now create the document that will later contain a primary text and all of its annotations. We present two ways of creating a document. First an easier way, where we use helpful methods provided by Salt and second an alternative, where we do it manually.</p>
<pre>
//creates a new document named sampleDocument, and adds it as part of sampleCorpus
SDocument sampleDocument=  corpGraph.createDocument(URI.createURI("/sampleCorpus/sampleDocument"));
</pre><h4>Alternative</h4>
<p>Alternatively you can add an already existing document to the corpus structure and use the <em>addDocument</em> method. </p>
<pre>
SDocument sampleDocument= SaltFactory.createSDocument();
sampleDocument.setName("sampleDocument");
//adds the document to the graph and automatically creates an relations between the corpus and the document
corpGraph.addDocument(sampleCorpus, sampleDocument);</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="documentStructure"></a>Document Structure</h3>
<p>Now we are leaving the corpus structure and go to the document structure. The difference between both is that the corpus structure groups corpora and documents to super- and sub-corpora and documents, and the document structure contains primary data and their annotations. Therefore we need to add an <em>SDocumentGraph</em> object to the <em>SDocument</em>, which acts as container for the primary data and linguistic annotations.</p>
<pre>
sampleDocument.setDocumentGraph(SaltFactory.createSDocumentGraph());
</pre><h3>Primary Data</h3>
<p>We now show how to add a primary text like "Is this example more complicated than it appears to?" to the document graph. We first show the easy way of creating primary data and than we show the more explicit way.</p>
<pre>
STextualDS primaryText = sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createTextualDS("Is this example more complicated than it appears to be?");
</pre><p>Even the primary text and in general the primary data in Salt are modeled as nodes with labels. The specific node, which is the container for the primary text is the node <em>STextualDS</em>, which is a subclass of <em>SSequentialDS</em>. The <em>String</em> representing the text is stored in a label of that node, which can be accessed via <em>STextualDS.getSText()</em> or <em>STextualDS.setSText(text)</em>.</p>
<h4>Alternative</h4>
<pre>
STextualDS primaryText = SaltFactory.createSTextualDS();
// set the primary text to the sentence
// "Is this example more complicated than it appears to be?"
primaryText.setText("Is this example more complicated than it appears to?");
// add the text to the document-graph
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addNode(primaryText);
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="tokenization"></a>Tokenization</h3>
<p>Sometimes it might be necessary to manually tokenize a text yourself. For instance if you don't want to have a word tokenization, or for historical text, where separators are missing.</p>
<p>A token in Salt is not bound to a linguistic unit - in this example we show how to tokenize words, although tokenizations by characters, syllables or sentences and so on are possible, too. The following figure shows an excerpt of the document graph we want to model in Salt. The figure only shows the tokens overlapping the words 'Is', 'this', 'example' and '.'.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="./images/userGuide/sample_tokenization.png" />
</div>
<p>For tokenizing a primary text, we need the character offset of the start and the end position for each token in the text. The word "Is" in the sample text, for instance, has the start position 0 and the end position 1. Note that the positions are counted <b>between</b> two characters.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<td></td><td>Is</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>this</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>example</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>more</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>complicated</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>than</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>it</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>appears</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>to</td><td></td><td>BLANK</td><td></td><td>be</td><td></td><td>?</td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td><td></td><td>2</td><td></td><td>3</td><td></td><td>7</td><td></td><td>8</td><td></td><td>15</td><td></td><td>16</td><td></td><td>20</td><td></td><td>21</td><td></td><td>32</td><td></td><td>33</td><td></td><td>37</td><td></td><td>38</td><td></td><td>40</td><td></td><td>41</td><td></td><td>48</td><td></td><td>49</td><td></td><td>51</td><td></td><td>52</td><td></td><td>54</td><td>55  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>In the given table, BLANK is an alias for the whitespace character (' ').</p>
<p>Salt provides a tokenizer to tokenize a primary text. This tokenizer is an adaptation of the TreeTagger tokenizer (see: <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/">http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/</a>). The tokenizer uses blanks and punctuation (taking abbreviations into account), and so on, to separate words. The usage of the tokenizer is quite simple as the following snippet shows:</p>
<pre>
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().tokenize();
</pre><p> To access the created tokens you can iterate over the token's list:</p>
<pre>
sampleDocument.getSDocumentGraph().getTokens();
</pre><p>or token by token:</p>
<pre>
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().getTokens().get(0);
</pre><p>In the following snippet we show an example of creating a tokenization manually by creating just one token. The creation of all other tokens is done in the same manner.</p>
<pre>
//create tokens manually 
SToken tok_is= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 0, 2);
SToken tok_this= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 3, 7);
SToken tok_example= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 8, 15);
SToken tok_more= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 16, 20);
SToken tok_complicated= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 21, 32);
SToken tok_than= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 33, 37);
SToken tok_it= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 38, 41);
SToken tok_appears= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 42, 48);
SToken tok_to= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 49, 51);
SToken tok_be= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 52, 54);
SToken tok_PUNC= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createToken(primaryText, 54, 55);
</pre><p> Now the token will be added to the morphology layer. A layer in Salt is represented by the element <em>SLayer</em> and defines a kind of a sub-graph, for instance for clustering nodes in a specific linguistic analysis. The snippet also shows the annotation of tokens with part-of-speech and lemma annotations using the element <em>SAnnotation</em>.</p>
<pre>
//creating a layer named morphology
SLayer morphLayer = SaltFactory.createSLayer();
morphLayer.setName("morphology");
sampleDocument.addLayer(morphLayer);</pre><pre>//adding the new token to the morphology layer
morphLayer.addNode(tok_is);
//adding a part-of-speech annotation to the new token
tok_is.createAnnotation(null, "pos", "VBZ");
//adding a lemma annotation to the new token
tok_is.createAnnotation(null, "lemma", "be");
//...
</pre><p>Again, we did not explicitly create the relations: their creation is hidden in the method <em>createSToken()</em>. But in the background Salt creates a node of type <em>SToken</em> for the token and a relation called <em>STextualRelation</em> which connects the token and the primary data node. Since Salt does not know any further elements other than the graph elements mentioned, the character positions, to which the tokens refer, are stored as labels of the relations. For such a kind of label we use a special type named <em>SFeature</em>. When just working with Salt and not creating an own derived meta model, the mechanism is not important. It is just important, that the positions can be set and retrieved via the methods <em>STextualRelation.getSStart()</em> or <em>STextualRelation.setSStart(value)</em>. The same goes for the end position <em>SEnd</em>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="hierarchies"></a>Hierarchies</h3>
<p>In Salt you can create hierarchies, e.g., in order to model syntactic annotations such as constituents. These hierarchies are realized via the node <em>SStructure</em> and can be connected to each other via relations of type <em>SDominanceRelation</em>. A relation of that type has the semantics of a part-of relation, which means that the target of that relation is a part of the source of that relation. In this example, we want to create a syntactic analysis as part of a syntactic layer. The following figure shows the structure we will create in this step of the example.</p>
<pre>
                      ROOT-----------------

          /    /          /           /      S    \
         /    /          /           /      / \    \
        /    /          /           /      /   VP   \
       /    /          /           /      /  /   \   \
      /    /          /           /      /   |    S   \
     /    /           |           |     /    |     \   \
    /    /            |           |    /     |      VP  \
   /    NP           ADJA         |    NP    |     /  \  \
  /    /   \       /      \       |    |     |     |  VP |
  |    |   |       |      |       |    |     |     |  |  |
 Is this example more complicated than it appears to be  ?
</pre><p>The following snippet gives an impression of how to create that hierarchy. We just show the creation of the left NP node and the SQ node.</p>
<pre>
//create a list of nodes, which shall be overlapped by the NP-node
List&lt;SStructuredNode&gt; overlappingNodes= new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
overlappingNodes.add(tok_this);
overlappingNodes.add(tok_example);
//adding NP-Node to graph and automatically creating relations to overlapping nodes
SStructure np_1= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createStructure(overlappingNodes);
np_1.createAnnotation(null, "cat", "NP");
//...</pre><pre>//create a list of nodes, which shall be overlapping by SQ-node
overlappingNodes= new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
overlappingNodes.add(tok_is);
overlappingNodes.add(np_1);
SStructure sq= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createStructure(overlappingNodes);
sq.createAnnotation(null, "cat", "SQ");</pre><pre>//create a syntax layer
SLayer syntaxLayer = SaltFactory.createSLayer();
syntaxLayer.setName("syntax");
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addLayer(syntaxLayer);</pre><pre>//add syntactic nodes to syntax layer
syntaxLayer.addNode(np_1);
syntaxLayer.addNode(sq);
//...
</pre><p>For annotating a dominance relation or any other relation, you can access it by querying all relations between two nodes:</p>
<pre>
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().getRelations(np_1.getId(), tok_is.getId()).get(0).createAnnotation("myNamespace", "myName", "myValue");
</pre><h4>Alternative</h4>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a hierarchy one step after another. The following snippet exemplifies this process for the same sample (the token for 'is' and the SQ node):</p>
<pre>
SStructure sq = SaltFactory.createSStructure();
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addNode(sq);
sq.createAnnotation(null, "cat", "SQ");</pre><pre>SDominanceRelation domRel = SaltFactory.createSDominanceRelation();
domRel.setSource(sq);
domRel.setTarget(tok_is);
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addRelation(domRel);
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="spans"></a>Spans</h3>
<p>If a whole (possibly discontinuous) set of nodes has to be annotated with the very same annotation, a span can be used to aggregate the nodes. Instead of an annotation for each node, a single annotation for the span can be created then. This annotation belongs to the set of nodes (the span), but not to any of the single nodes. In our example we show the use of spans building an information structure analysis. Spans in Salt are realized by nodes of the type <em>SSpan</em>, they are connected to <em>SToken</em> nodes via relations of type <em>SSpanningRelation</em>. The following figure shows the information structure analysis to be modeled.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="./images/userGuide/sample_span.png" />
</div>
<p>The following snippet shows the code used to create the analysis shown in the figure.</p>
<pre>
//create span overlaping only one token
SSpan contrast_focus= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createSpan(tok_is);
contrast_focus.createAnnotation(null, "inf-struct", "contrast-focus");</pre><pre>//create a list of tokens taking part in the set to be annotated as a bundle
List&lt;SToken&gt; overlappingTokens= new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
overlappingTokens.add(tok_this);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_example);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_more);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_complicated);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_than);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_it);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_appears);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_to);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_be);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_PUNC);</pre><pre>//create span overlaping a set of tokens        
SSpan topic= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createSpan(overlappingTokens);
topic.createAnnotation(null, "inf-struct", "topic");
</pre><h4>Alternative</h4>
<p>Alternatively to using the method createSSpan(...) you can create the span and the corresponding <em>SSpanningRelations</em> on your own. The following snippet gives an impression of how to create the same span as in the last example, step by step:</p>
<pre>
SSpan contrast_focus= SaltFactory.createSSpan();
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addNode(contrast_focus);
SSpanningRelation spanRel= SaltFactory.createSSpanningRelation();
spanRel.setSource(contrast_focus);
spanRel.setTarget(tok_is);
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="pointingRelations"></a>Pointing Relations</h3>
<p>Now we will show another type of relation, which renders a more loose relation between nodes. In contrast to <em>SSpanningRelations</em> and <em>SDominanceRelations</em>, which can only connect specific kinds of nodes, the type <em>SPointingRelation</em> can connect <em>SToken</em>, <em>SSpan</em> and <em>SStructure</em> nodes with each other and vice versa. These relations for instance can be used to model anaphoric relations between words, phrases, sentences and so on. Relations in general can be typed with a linguistic meaning by setting their attribute <em>SType</em>. We illustrate that by connecting the token covering the word "it" to the set of tokens "the" and "example". To bundle the words "the" and "example", we first have to create a span covering both tokens "the" and "example" following the same mechanism as shown in section <a href="#spans">Spans</a>.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="./images/userGuide/salt_pointRel.svg"  style="width:30%" alt="Salt graph pointing relations"/>
</div>
<p>The following snippet shows the creation of the model shown in the figure.</p>
<pre>
//create a span covering the words "the" and "example"
overlappingTokens= new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
overlappingTokens.add(tok_this);
overlappingTokens.add(tok_example);
SSpan span= sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().createSpan(overlappingTokens);</pre><pre>//creating a pointing relations
SPointingRelation pointingRelation= SaltFactory.createSPointingRelation();
//setting token "it" as source of this relation
pointingRelation.setSource(tok_it);
//setting span "this example" as target of this relation
pointingRelation.setTarget(span);
//adding the created relation to the document-graph
sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph().addRelation(pointingRelation);
//adding the type to the relation

<p>After we have shown how to create a Salt model, we now show some methods to access its data. If you start reading from here, and did not already have a Salt model, you can use the class SampleGenerator, to generate predefined sample models. </p>
<pre>
SDocument sampleDocument = SaltFactory.createSDocument();
SampleGenerator.createSDocumentStructure(sampleDocument);
SDocumentGraph docGraph = sampleDocument.getDocumentGraph();
</pre><p> The following snippet exemplifies accessing a Salt model. If you copy the following lines and run the code you won't see anything. There are no outputs in the code below.</p>
<pre>
//access all primary text nodes (getting a list)
docGraph.getTextualDSs();
//access the primary text of the first primary text node
docGraph.getTextualDSs().get(0).getText();</pre><pre>//access all token nodes (getting a list)
docGraph.getTokens();
//access the primary text, which is overlapped by the first token (note: changing the returned text has no effects)
docGraph.getText(docGraph.getTokens().get(0));
//access all annotations of the first token
docGraph.getTokens().get(0).getAnnotations();</pre><pre>//access the relations between all tokens and their primary text nodes
docGraph.getTextualRelations();
//access the interval determining the overlapped text of the first relation (which probably is related to the first token)
docGraph.getTextualRelations().get(0).getStart();
docGraph.getTextualRelations().get(0).getEnd();</pre><pre>//access all span nodes  (getting a list)
docGraph.getSpans();
//access the primary text, which is overlapped by the first span (note: changing the returned text has no effects)
docGraph.getText(docGraph.getSpans().get(0));
//access all relations between all spans and their tokens 
docGraph.getSpanningRelations();</pre><pre>//access all hierarchical nodes (structures)
docGraph.getStructures();
//access the primary text, which is overlapped by the first structure (note: changing the returned text has no effects)
docGraph.getText(docGraph.getStructures().get(0));
//access all dominance relations (relations between all structures and their other nodes)
docGraph.getDominanceRelations();
//access all annotations of the first dominance relation
docGraph.getDominanceRelations().get(0).getAnnotations();</pre><pre>//access all pointing relations 
docGraph.getPointingRelations();
//access all annotations of the first pointing relation
docGraph.getDominanceRelations().get(0).getAnnotations();</pre><pre>//access all roots of the document graph
docGraph.getRoots();</pre><pre>//access all nodes and relations contained in the document graph
docGraph.getNodes();
docGraph.getRelations();</pre><pre>//access all outgoing relations of a node (the first structure node)
List&lt;SRelation&lt;SNode, SNode&gt;&gt; out= docGraph.getOutRelations(docGraph.getStructures().get(0).getId());
//access all incoming relations of a node (the first structure node)
List&lt;SRelation&lt;SNode, SNode&gt;&gt; in= docGraph.getInRelations(docGraph.getStructures().get(0).getId());
</pre><p> So far we havn't talked about how to traverse the document graph. This is done in section <a href="#traversing">Traversing graphs</a>. </p>
