Salt {#mainpage}
======

With Salt we provide an easily understandable meta model for linguistic data and an open source API for storing, manipulating and representing data. Salt is an abstract model, poor in linguistic semantics. As a result, it is independent of any linguistic schools or theories. The core model is graph-based, thereby keeping the structural restrictions very low and allowing for a wide range of possible linguistic annotations, such as syntactic, morphological, coreferential annotations and many more. You can even model your own very personal annotation as long as it fits into a graph structure (and so far we have not seen a linguistic annotation which does not). Furthermore, Salt does not depend on a specific linguistic tagset which allows you to use every tagset you like.
