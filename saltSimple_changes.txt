Semantic changes in simple Salt
- An id of Node, Layer, Edge cannot be set, it is only set when adding such an object to a graph
- the list of nodes, layers and edges returned by the graph is immutable
- A layer has sets with preserved order instead of lists for nodes and relations
- a layer provides addNode and addEdge method, it is recommended to use them and not to add things directlyx into the list
